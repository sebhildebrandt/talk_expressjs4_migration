# Migrating from ExpressJS 3.0 to 4.0
==========================

## Demo Code Express 4.0 - Boilerplate Server

This (very basic) boilerplate server shows:

- basic dependencies (see package.json)
- middleware for static files, favicon, sessions
- basic app confiuration
- logging in dev-mode

with ExpressJS 4.0
